# Compliment - Node.js

This project was developed in the NLW Together event from Rocketseat.
<br />

# Project

This part of the project made with Node, serves as an API REST.

The idea of the app is to compliment users. You can send compliments to any user, view your received and sent compliments, view the list of users and the list of tags used to categorize the compliments.

It has the functionalities:

- Create Users
- Authenticate Users
- Send Compliments
- List Users
- List Tags
- Create Tags (only admin)
- List received compliments
- List sent compliments

I used JWT to deal with the authentication part of the API.

And I also needed to add a functionality to the API that is list the data about the authenticated user.
